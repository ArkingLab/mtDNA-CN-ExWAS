This folder contains a build GRCh38 PLINK-format genetic map created by Xiaowen Tian 
(tianx3@uw.edu).

The map was generated by lifting the build GRCh37 genetic map created by Adam Auton 
(http://bochet.gcc.biostat.washington.edu/beagle/genetic_maps/plink.GRCh37.map.zip).

The conversion from build 37 to build 38 was performed using liftMap_b37tob38.py 
(https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/LiftOver#Lift_PLINK_format) which employs the 
UCSC liftover tool to convert physical coordinates from GRCh37 to GRCh38.

After applying the liftover tool, SNPs with inconsistent order in GRCh37 and GRCh38 
were removed using the following method:

1) Make two copies of the list of SNPs that were assigned GRCh38 positions by liftover.

2) Order the first list by GRCh38 position, and order the second list by GRCh37 position.

3) Calculate the difference in GRCh38 position of each pair of SNPs having the same rank 
(i.e. list index) in the two lists.

4) Find the rank with the largest difference in step 3.  If there are multiple ranks with 
the largest difference, select the first one. Select the SNP with this rank in the list 
ordered by GRCh37 position, and remove this SNP from both lists.

5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all SNPs have the same order in both lists.
